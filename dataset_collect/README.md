# Dataset collection
## Policy Dataset Collection
Use gpt_sample.sh with your own API key.
## Reward Dataset Collection
Use interpolate.sh to get different models, then run sample_solution.sh to sample solutions with labels.
We use SGlang for generation. Please check the way of usage on [https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang). You only need to run the server through sgl_model.sh.
