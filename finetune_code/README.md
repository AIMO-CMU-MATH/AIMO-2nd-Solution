# Finetune Scripts
The code in this folder is used to fine-tune both our policy model and reward model. It is adapted from the [gpt-fast](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/gpt-fast) project.

It runs a few hours for both policy model and reward model on 8 x A6000 GPUs. 8 x H100 will be much faster (an hour).
