        "solution": "Consider the graph of $f(x)=|x-a|+|x-b|+|x-c|$\nWhen $x<a$ , the slope is $-3$\nWhen $a<x<b$ , the slope is $-1$\nWhen $b<x<c$ , the slope is $1$\nWhen $c<x$ , the slope is $3$\nSetting $x=b$ gives $y=|b-a|+|b-b|+|b-c|=c-a$ , so $(b,c-a)$ is a point on $f(x)$ . In fact, it is the minimum of $f(x)$ considering the slope of lines to the left and right of $(b,c-a)$ . Thus, graphing this will produce a figure that looks like a cup: [asy] import graph; size(100); draw((0,6)--(3,0)); xaxis(0,8.5); yaxis(0,10); real f(real x) { return -3(x-2)+5; } real f2(real x) { return -1(x-2)+5; } real f3(real x) { return 1(x-4)+3; } real f4(real x) { return 3(x-7)+6; } draw(graph(f,0,2)); draw(graph(f2,2,4)); draw(graph(f3,4,7)); draw(graph(f4,7,8.5)); draw((2,-0.25)--(2,0.25)); label(\"a\",(2,0),N); draw((4,-0.25)--(4,0.25)); label(\"b\",(4,0),N); draw((7,-0.25)--(7,0.25)); label(\"c\",(7,0),N); dot((2,5)); label(\"P\",(1.9,5.2),E); [/asy] From the graph, it is clear that $f(x)$ and $2x+y=2003$ have one intersection point if and only if they intersect at $x=a$ . Since the line where $a<x<b$ has slope $-1$ , the positive difference in $y$ -coordinates from $x=a$ to $x=b$ must be $b-a$ . Together with the fact that $(b,c-a)$ is on $f(x)$ , we see that $P=(a,c-a+b-a)$ . Since this point is on $x=a$ , the only intersection point with $2x+y=2003$ , we have $2 \\cdot a+(b+c-2a)=2003 \\implies b+c=2003$ . As $c>b$ , the smallest possible value of $c$ occurs when $b=1001$ and $c=1002$ . This is indeed a solution as $a=1000$ puts $P$ on $y=2003-2x$ , and thus the answer is $\\boxed{1002}$",

        "problem": "Let $k$ be a positive integer. Bernardo and Silvia take turns writing and erasing numbers on a blackboard as follows: Bernardo starts by writing the smallest perfect square with $k+1$ digits. Every time Bernardo writes a number, Silvia erases the last $k$ digits of it. Bernardo then writes the next perfect square, Silvia erases the last $k$ digits of it, and this process continues until the last two numbers that remain on the board differ by at least 2. Let $f(k)$ be the smallest positive integer not written on the board. For example, if $k = 1$ , then the numbers that Bernardo writes are $16, 25, 36, 49, 64$ , and the numbers showing on the board after Silvia erases are $1, 2, 3, 4,$ and $6$ , and thus $f(1) = 5$ . What is the sum of the digits of $f(2) + f(4)+ f(6) + \\dots + f(2016)$",
        "solution": "Consider $f(2)$ . The numbers left on the blackboard will show the hundreds place at the end. In order for the hundreds place to differ by 2, the difference between two perfect squares needs to be at least $100$ . Since $100\\le (x+1)^2-x^2=2x+1$ , this first happens at $x\\ge \\lfloor 99/2\\rfloor = 50$ . The perfect squares from here go: $2500,  2601, 2704, 2809\\dots$ . Note that the ones and tens also make the perfect squares, $1^2,2^2,3^2\\dots$ . After the ones and tens make $100$ , the hundreds place will go up by $2$ , thus reaching our goal. Since $10^2=100$ , the last perfect square to be written will be $\\left(50+10\\right)^2=60^2=3600$ . The missing number is one less than the number of hundreds $(k=2)$ of $3600$ , or $35$\nNow consider $f(4)$ . Instead of the difference between two squares needing to be $100$ , the difference must now be $10000$ . This first happens at $x\\ge 5000$ . After this point, similarly, $\\sqrt{10000}=100$ more numbers are needed to make the $10^4$ th's place go up by $2$ . This will take place at $\\left(5000+100\\right)^2=5100^2= 26010000$ . Removing the last four digits (the zeros) and subtracting one yields $2600$ for the skipped value.\nIn general, each new value of $f(k+2)$ will add two digits to the \" $5$ \" and one digit to the \" $1$ \". This means that the last number Bernardo writes for $k=6$ is $\\left(500000+1000\\right)^2$ , the last for $k = 8$ will be $\\left(50000000+10000\\right)^2$ , and so on until $k=2016$ . Removing the last $k$ digits as Silvia does will be the same as removing $k/2$ trailing zeroes on the number to be squared. This means that the last number on the board for $k=6$ is $5001^2$ $k=8$ is $50001^2$ , and so on. So the first missing number is $5001^2-1,50001^2-1\\text{ etc.}$ The squaring will make a \" $25$ \" with two more digits than the last number, a \" $10$ \" with one more digit, and a \" $1$ \". The missing number is one less than that, so the \"1\" will be subtracted from $f(k)$ . In other words, $f(k) = 25\\cdot 10^{k-2}+1\\cdot 10^{k/2}$\nTherefore:\n\\[f(2) =35 =25 +10\\] \\[f(4) =2600 =2500 +100\\] \\[f(6) =251000 =250000 +1000\\] \\[f(8) = 25010000 = 25000000 + 10000\\]\nAnd so on. The sum $f(2) + f(4) + f(6) +\\dots + f(2016)$ is:\n$2.52525252525\\dots 2525\\cdot 10^{2015}$ $1.11111\\dots 110\\cdot 10^{1008}$ , with $2016$ repetitions each of \" $25$ \" and \" $1$ \". \nThere is no carrying in this addition. Therefore each $f(k)$ adds $2 + 5 + 1 = 8$ to the sum of the digits. \nSince $2n = 2016$ $n = 1008$ , and $8n = 8064$ , or $\\boxed{8064}$",

        "solution": "The problem asks us to find the sum of every integer value of $a$ such that the roots of $x^2 - ax + 2a = 0$ are both integers.\nThe quadratic formula gives the roots of the quadratic equation: $x=\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-8a}}{2}$\nAs long as the numerator is an even integer, the roots are both integers. But first of all, the radical term in the numerator needs to be an integer; that is, the discriminant $a^2 - 8a$ equals $k^2$ , for some nonnegative integer $k$\n$a^2-8a=k^2$\n$a(a-8)=k^2$\n$((a-4)+4)((a-4)-4)=k^2$\n$(a-4)^2-4^2=k^2$\n$(a-4)^2=k^2+4^2$\nFrom this last equation, we are given a hint of the Pythagorean theorem. Thus, $(k,4,|a-4|)$ must be a Pythagorean triple unless $k = 0$\nIn the case $k=0$ , the equation simplifies to $|a-4|=4$ . From this equation, we have $a=0,8$ . For both $a=0$ and $a=8$ $\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-8a}}{2}$ yields two integers, so these values satisfy the constraints from the original problem statement. (Note: the two zero roots count as \"two integers.\")\nIf $k$ is a positive integer, then only one Pythagorean triple could match the triple $(k,4,|a - 4|)$ because the only Pythagorean triple with a $4$ as one of the values is the classic $(3,4,5)$ triple. Here, $k=3$ and $|a-4|=5$ . Hence, $a=-1,9$ . Again, $\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-8a}}{2}$ yields two integers for both $a=-1$ and $a=9$ , so these two values also satisfy the original constraints.\nThere are a total of four possible values for $a$ $-1,0,8,$ and $9$ . Hence, the sum of all of the possible values of $a$ is $\\boxed{16}$",

        "solution": "Consider a general quadratic with the coefficient of $x^2$ being $1$ and the roots being $r$ and $s$ . It can be factored as $(x-r)(x-s)$ which is just $x^2-(r+s)x+rs$ . Thus, the sum of the roots is the negative of the coefficient of $x$ and the product is the constant term. (In general, this leads to Vieta's Formulas ).\nWe now have that the sum of the two roots is $63$ while the product is $k$ . Since both roots are primes, one must be $2$ , otherwise, the sum would be even. That means the other root is $61$ and the product must be $122$ . Hence, our answer is $\\boxed{1}$",

In degrees, what is the largest possible sum of the two largest angles of $ABCD$",
        "solution": "Since the angles of Quadrilateral $ABCD$ form an arithmetic sequence, we can assign each angle with the value $a$ $a+d$ $a+2d$ , and $a+3d$ . Also, since these angles form an arithmetic progression, we can reason out that $(a)+(a+3d)=(a+d)+(a+2d)=180$\nFor the sake of simplicity, lets rename the angles of each similar triangle. Let $\\angle ADB = \\angle CBD = \\alpha$ $\\angle DBA = \\angle DCB = \\beta$ $\\angle CDB = \\angle BAD = \\gamma$\nNow the four angles of $ABCD$ are $\\beta$ $\\alpha + \\beta$ $\\gamma$ , and $\\alpha + \\gamma$\nAs for the similar triangles, we can name their angles $y$ $y+b$ , and $y+2b$ . Therefore $y+y+b+y+2b=180$ and $y+b=60$ . Because these 3 angles are each equal to one of $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ , we know that one of these three angles is equal to 60 degrees.\nNow we we use trial and error. Let $\\alpha = 60^{\\circ}$ . Then the angles of ABCD are $\\beta$ $60^{\\circ} + \\beta$ $\\gamma$ , and $60^{\\circ} + \\gamma$ . Since these four angles add up to 360, then $\\beta + \\gamma= 120$ . If we list them in increasing value, we get $\\beta$ $\\gamma$ $60^{\\circ} + \\beta$ $60^{\\circ} + \\gamma$ . Note that this is the only sequence that works because the common difference is less than 45. So, this would give us the four angles 45, 75, 105, and 135. In this case, $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ also form an arithmetic sequence with 45, 60, and 75, and the largest two angles of the quadrilateral add up to 240 which is an answer choice.\nIf we apply the same reasoning to $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ , we would get the sum of the highest two angles as 220, which works but is lower than 240.

        "problem": "When $n$ standard six-sided dice are rolled, the product of the numbers rolled can be any of $936$ possible values. What is $n$",
        "solution": "We start by trying to prove a function of $n$ , and then we can apply the function and equate it to $936$ to find the value of $n$\nIt is helpful to think of this problem in the format $(1+2+3+4+5+6) \\cdot (1+2+3+4+5+6) \\dots$ . Note that if we represent the scenario in this manner, we can think of picking a $1$ for one factor and then a $5$ for another factor to form their product - this is similar thinking to when we have the factorized form of a polynomial. Unfortunately this is not quite accurate to the problem because we can reach the same product in many ways: for example for $n=2$ $4$ can be reached by picking $1$ and $4$ or $2$ and $2$ . However, this form gives us insights that will be useful later in the problem.\nNote that there are only $3$ primes in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ $2,3,$ and $5$ . Thus if we're forming the product of possible values of a dice roll, the product has to be written in the form $2^h \\cdot 3^i \\cdot 5^j$ (the choice of variables will become clear later), for integer nonnegative values $h,i,j$ . So now the problem boils down to how many distinct triplets $(h,i,j)$ can be formed by taking the product of $n$ dice values.\nWe start our work on representing $j$ : the powers of $5$ , because it is the simplest in this scenario because there is only one factor of $5$ in the set. Because of this, having $j$ fives in our prime factorization of the product is equivalent to picking $j$ factors from the polynomial $(1+\\dots + 6) \\cdots$ and choosing each factor to be a $5$ . Now that we've selected $j$ factors, there are $n-j$ factors remaining to choose our powers of $3$ and $2$\nSuppose our prime factorization of this product contains $i$ powers of $3$ . These powers of $3$ can either come from a $3$ factor or a $6$ factor, but since both $3$ and $6$ contain only one power of $3$ , this means that a product with $i$ powers of $3$ corresponds directly to picking $i$ factors from the polynomial, each of which is either $3$ or $6$ (but this distinction doesn't matter when we consider only the powers of $3$\nNow we can reframe the problem again. Our method will be as follows: Suppose we choose an arbitrary pair $(i,j)$ that match the requirements, corresponding to the number of $3$ 's and the number of $5$ 's our product will have. Then how many different $h$ values for the powers of $2$ are possible?\nIn the $i+j$ factors we have already chosen, we obviously can't have any factors of $2$ in the $j$ factors with $5$ . However, we can have a factor of $2$ pairing with factors of $3$ , if we choose a $6$ . The maximal possible power of $2$ in these $i$ factors is thus $2^i$ , which occurs when we pick every factor to be $6$\nWe now have $n-i-j$ factors remaining, and we want to allocate these to solely powers of $2$ . For each of these factors, we can choose either a $1,2,$ or $4$ . Therefore the maximal power of $2$ achieved in these factors is when we pick $4$ for all of them, which is equivalent to $2^{2\\cdot (n-i-j)}$\nNow if we multiply this across the total $n$ factors (or $n$ dice) we have a total of $2^{2n-2i-2j} \\cdot 2^i = 2^{2n-i-2j}$ , which is the maximal power of $2$ attainable in the product for a pair $(i,j)$ . Now note that every power of $2$ below this power is attainable: we can simply just take away a power of $2$ from an existing factor by dividing by $2$ . Therefore the powers of $2$ , and thus the $h$ value ranges from $h=0$ to $h=2n-i-2j$ , so there are a total of $2n+1-i-2j$ distinct values for $h$ for a given pair $(i,j)$\nNow to find the total number of distinct triplets, we must sum this across all possible $i$ s and $j$ s. Lets take note of our restrictions on $i,j$ : the only restriction is that $i+j \\leq n$ , since we're picking factors from $n$ dice.\n\\[\\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} 2n+1 - \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j\\]\nWe start by calculating the first term. $2n+1$ is constant, so we just need to find out how many pairs there are such that $i+j \\leq n$ . Set $i$ to $0$ $j$ can range from $0$ to $n$ , then set $i$ to $1$ $j$ can range from $0$ to $n-1$ , etc. The total number of pairs is thus $n+1+n+n-1+\\dots+1 = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$ . Therefore the left summation evaluates to \\[\\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\]\nNow we calculate $\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j$ . This simplifies to $\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i + 2 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} j$ . Note that because $i+j = n$ is symmetric with respect to $i,j$ , the sum of $i$ in all of the pairs will be equal to the sum of $j$ in all of the pairs. Thus this is equal to calculating $3 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i$\nIn the pairs, $i=1$ appears for $j$ ranging between $0$ and $n-1$ so the sum here is $1 \\cdot (n)$ . Similarly $i=2$ appears for $j$ ranging from $0$ to $n-2$ , so the sum is $2 \\cdot (n-1)$ . If we continue the pattern, the sum overall is $(n)+2 \\cdot (n-1) + 3 \\cdot (n-2) + \\dots + (n) \\cdot 1$ . We can rearrange this as $((n)+(n-1)+ \\dots + 1) + ((n-1)+(n-2)+ \\dots + 1)+ ((n-2)+(n-3)+ \\dots + 1) + \\dots + 1)$\n\\[= \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2} + \\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2}+ \\dots + 1\\]\nWe can write this in easier terms as $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{(k)(k+1)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2+k$ \\[=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2 + \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k)\\] \\[= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2})\\] \\[= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{3n(n+1)}{6}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+4)}{6}\\] \\[= \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}\\]\nWe multiply this by $3$ to obtain that \\[\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\]\nThus our final answer for the number of distinct triplets $(h,i,j)$ is: \\[\\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2} - \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\] \\[= \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (2n+1-n) = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (n+1)\\] \\[= \\frac{(n+1)^2(n+2)}{2}\\]\nNow most of the work is done. We set this equal to $936$ and prime factorize. $936 = 12 \\cdot 78 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$ , so $(n+1)^2(n+2) = 936 \\cdot 2 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$ . Clearly $13$ cannot be anything squared and $2^4 \\cdot 3^2$ is a perfect square, so $n+2 = 13$ and $n = 11 = \\boxed{11}$",

This means we have $5*2=10$ possibilities for choosing 5 neighboring diameters. However, notice that there are duplicates, so we divide the $10$ possibilities by $2$ to get $5$\nNote that there cannot be a case with $4$ diameters because then there would have to be $5$ diameters for the two remaining people as they have to be connected with a diameter.

On this interval, $f$ is negative in both endpoints, and we know that it is first increasing and then decreasing. Hence there can be zero, one, or two roots on this interval.\nTo prove that there are two roots, it is enough to find any $x$ from this interval such that $f(x)>0$\nA good guess is its midpoint, $x=5\\pi/12$ , where the function $\\sin^{-1}(\\sin 6x)$ has its local maximum. We can evaluate: $f(x) = \\sin^{-1}(\\sin 5\\pi/2) - 5\\pi/12 = \\pi/2 - 5\\pi/12 = \\pi/12 > 0$\nSummary: The function $f$ has $\\boxed{4}$ roots on $[0,\\pi]$ : the first one is $0$ , the second one is in $(0,\\pi/6)$ , and the last two are in $(2\\pi/6,3\\pi/6)$",

        "solution": "First, we can test values that would make $f(x)=12$ true. For this to happen $x$ must have $6$ divisors, which means its prime factorization is in the form $pq^2$ or $p^5$ , where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers. Listing out values less than $50$ which have these prime factorizations, we find $12,18,20,28,44,45,50$ for $pq^2$ , and just $32$ for $p^5$ . Here $12$ especially catches our eyes, as this means if one of $f_i(n)=12$ , each of $f_{i+1}(n), f_{i+2}(n), ...$ will all be $12$ . This is because $f_{i+1}(n)=f(f_i(n))$ (as given in the problem statement), so were $f_i(n)=12$ , plugging this in we get $f_{i+1}(n)=f(12)=12$ , and thus the pattern repeats. Hence, as long as for a $i$ , such that $i\\leq 50$ and $f_{i}(n)=12$ $f_{50}(n)=12$ must be true, which also immediately makes all our previously listed numbers, where $f(x)=12$ , possible values of $n$\nWe also know that if $f(x)$ were to be any of these numbers, $x$ would satisfy $f_{50}(n)$ as well. Looking through each of the possibilities aside from $12$ , we see that $f(x)$ could only possibly be equal to $20$ and $18$ , and still have $x$ less than or equal to $50$ . This would mean $x$ must have $10$ , or $9$ divisors, and testing out, we see that $x$ will then be of the form $p^4q$ , or $p^2q^2$ .

        "solution": "Substitute $a^cb^d$ into $x$ . We then have $7(a^{5c}b^{5d}) = 11y^{13}$ . Divide both sides by $7$ , and it follows that:\n\\[(a^{5c}b^{5d}) = \\frac{11y^{13}}{7}.\\]\nNote that because $11$ and $7$ are prime, the minimum value of $x$ must involve factors of $7$ and $11$ only. Thus, we try to look for the lowest power $p$ of $11$ such that $13p + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ , so that we can take $11^{13p + 1}$ to the fifth root. Similarly, we want to look for the lowest power $n$ of $7$ such that $13n - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ . Again, this allows us to take the fifth root of $7^{13n - 1}$ . Obviously, we want to add $1$ to $13p$ and subtract $1$ from $13n$ because $11^{13p}$ and $7^{13n}$ are multiplied by $11$ and divided by $7$ , respectively. With these conditions satisfied, we can simply multiply $11^{p}$ and $7^{n}$ and substitute this quantity into $y$ to attain our answer.\nWe can simply look for suitable values for $p$ and $n$ . We find that the lowest $p$ , in this case, would be $3$ because $13(3) + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ . Moreover, the lowest $q$ should be $2$ because $13(2) - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ . Hence, we can substitute the quantity $11^{3} \\cdot 7^{2}$ into $y$ .

Observe that $BC=1$ is fixed, hence the circumcircle of cyclic pentagon $BCOIH$ is also fixed. Similarly, as $OB=OC$ (both are radii), it follows that $O$ and also $[BCO]$ is fixed.

We now prove that it is impossible to obtain two intersections.\nWe proceed by contradiction.  Assume a configuration of four lines exists such that there exist only two intersection points.  Let these intersection points be $A$ and $B$ .  Consider two cases:\nCase 1 :  No line passes through both $A$ and $B$\nThen, since an intersection point is obtained by an intersection between at least two lines, two lines pass through each of $A$ and $B$ .  Then, since there can be no additional intersections, the 2 lines that pass through $A$ cant intersect the 2 lines that pass through $B$ , and so 2 lines passing through $A$ must be parallel to 2 lines passing through $B$ . Then the two lines passing through $B$ are parallel to each other by transitivity of parallelism, so they coincide, contradiction.\nCase 2 :  There is a line passing through $A$ and $B$\nThen there must be a line $l_a$ passing through $A$ , and a line $l_b$ passing through $B$ .  These lines must be parallel.  The fourth line $l$ must pass through either $A$ or $B$ .  Without loss of generality, suppose $l$ passes through $A$ .  Then since $l$ and $l_a$ cannot coincide, they cannot be parallel.  Then $l$ and $l_b$ cannot be parallel either, so they intersect, contradiction.\nAll possibilities have been exhausted, and thus we can conclude that two intersections is impossible.

(Also, $a_{2006}$ cannot be 1 in this case since $d$ does not divide $1$ , so we do not care about these $a_2$ at all.)\nFrom now on, suppose $\\gcd(999, a_2) = 1$\nWe will now show that $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ for some $i \\leq 2006$ . We will do this with 3 lemmas.\nLemma: If $a_j \\neq a_{j + 1}$ , and neither value is $0$ , then $\\max(a_j, a_{j + 1}) > \\max(a_{j + 2}, a_{j + 3})$\nProof: There are 2 cases to consider.\nIf $a_j > a_{j + 1}$ , then $a_{j + 2} = a_j - a_{j + 1}$ , and $a_{j + 3} = |a_j - 2a_{j + 1}|$ . So $a_j > a_{j + 2}$ and $a_j > a_{j + 3}$\nIf $a_j < a_{j + 1}$ , then $a_{j + 2} = a_{j + 1} - a_j$ , and $a_{j + 3} = a_j$ . So $a_{j + 1} > a_{j + 2}$ and $a_{j + 1} > a_{j + 3}$\nIn both cases, $\\max(a_j, a_{j + 1}) > \\max(a_{j + 2}, a_{j + 3})$ , as desired.\nLemma: If $a_i = a_{i + 1}$ , then $a_i = 1$ . Moreover, if instead we have $a_i = 0$ for some $i > 2$ , then $a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 2} = 1$\nProof: By the way $(a_n)$ is constructed in the problem statement, having two equal consecutive terms $a_i = a_{i + 1}$ implies that $a_i$ divides every term in the sequence. So $a_i | 999$ and $a_i | a_2$ , so $a_i | \\gcd(999, a_2) = 1$ , so $a_i = 1$ . For the proof of the second result, note that if $a_i = 0$ , then $a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 2}$ , so by the first result we just proved, $a_{i - 2} = a_{i - 1} = 1$\nLemma: $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ for some $i \\leq 2000$\nProof: Suppose $(a_n)$ completed at some $i > 2000$ or not at all. Then by the second lemma and the fact that neither $999$ nor $a_2$ are $0$ , none of the pairs $(a_1, a_2), ..., (a_{1999}, a_{2000})$ can have a $0$ or be equal to $(1, 1)$ . So the first lemma implies \\[\\max(a_1, a_2) > \\max(a_3, a_4) > \\cdots > \\max(a_{1999}, a_{2000})  > 0,\\] so $999 = \\max(a_1, a_2) \\geq 1000$ , a contradiction. Hence $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ for some $i \\leq 2000$\nNow we're ready to find exactly which values of $a_2$ we want to count.\nLet's keep in mind that $2006 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ and that $a_1 = 999$ is odd. We have two cases to consider.\nCase 1: If $a_2$ is odd, then $a_3$ is even, so $a_4$ is odd, so $a_5$ is odd, so $a_6$ is even, and this pattern must repeat every three terms because of the recursive definition of $(a_n)$ , so the terms of $(a_n)$ reduced modulo 2 are \\[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ...,\\] so $a_{2006}$ is odd and hence $1$ (since if $(a_n)$ completes at $i$ , then $a_k$ must be $0$ or $1$ for all $k \\geq i$ ).\nCase 2: If $a_2$ is even, then $a_3$ is odd, so $a_4$ is odd, so $a_5$ is even, so $a_6$ is odd, and this pattern must repeat every three terms, so the terms of $(a_n)$ reduced modulo 2 are \\[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, ...,\\] so $a_{2006}$ is even, and hence $0$\nWe have found that $a_{2006} = 1$ is true precisely when $\\gcd(999, a_2) = 1$ and $a_2$ is odd. This tells us what we need to count.\nThere are $\\phi(999) = 648$ numbers less than $999$ and relatively prime to it ( $\\phi$ is the Euler totient function). We want to count how many of these are odd. Note that \\[t \\mapsto 999 - t\\] is a 1-1 correspondence between the odd and even numbers less than and relatively prime to $999$ . So our final answer is $648/2 = 324$ , or $\\boxed{324}$",

        "solution": "[asy] size(10cm); Label f;  f.p=fontsize(6);  xaxis(-6,6,Ticks(f, 2.0));  yaxis(-6,6,Ticks(f, 2.0));  filldraw(origin--(4,0)--(0,3)--cycle, gray, black+linewidth(1)); [/asy]\nFirst, any combination of motions we can make must reflect $T$ an even number of times. This is because every time we reflect $T$ , it changes orientation. Once $T$ has been flipped once, no combination of rotations will put it back in place because it is the mirror image; however, flipping it again changes it back to the original orientation. Since we are only allowed $3$ transformations and an even number of them must be reflections, we either reflect $T$ $0$ times or $2$ times.\nCase 1: $0$ reflections on $T$\nIn this case, we must use $3$ rotations to return $T$ to its original position. Notice that our set of rotations, $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$ , contains every multiple of $90^\\circ$ except for $0^\\circ$ . We can start with any two rotations $a,b$ in $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$ and there must be exactly one $c \\equiv -a - b \\pmod{360^\\circ}$ such that we can use the three rotations $(a,b,c)$ which ensures that $a + b + c \\equiv 0^\\circ \\pmod{360^\\circ}$ . That way, the composition of rotations $a,b,c$ yields a full rotation. For example, if $a = b = 90^\\circ$ , then $c \\equiv -90^\\circ - 90^\\circ = -180^\\circ \\pmod{360^\\circ}$ , so $c = 180^\\circ$ and the rotations $(90^\\circ,90^\\circ,180^\\circ)$ yields a full rotation.\nThe only case in which this fails is when $c$ would have to equal $0^\\circ$ . This happens when $(a,b)$ is already a full rotation, namely, $(a,b) = (90^\\circ,270^\\circ),(180^\\circ,180^\\circ),$ or $(270^\\circ,90^\\circ)$ . However, we can simply subtract these three cases from the total. Selecting $(a,b)$ from $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$ yields $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ choices, and with $3$ that fail, we are left with $6$ combinations for case $1$\nCase 2: $2$ reflections on $T$\nIn this case, we first eliminate the possibility of having two of the same reflection. Since two reflections across the x-axis maps $T$ back to itself, inserting a rotation before, between, or after these two reflections would change $T$ 's final location, meaning that any combination involving two reflections across the x-axis would not map $T$ back to itself. The same applies to two reflections across the y-axis.\nTherefore, we must use one reflection about the x-axis, one reflection about the y-axis, and one rotation. Since a reflection about the x-axis changes the sign of the y component, a reflection about the y-axis changes the sign of the x component, and a $180^\\circ$ rotation changes both signs, these three transformation composed (in any order) will suffice. It is therefore only a question of arranging the three, giving us $3! = 6$ combinations for case 2.\nCombining both cases we get $6+6=\\boxed{12}$",

        "problem": "Amy, Beth, and Jo listen to four different songs and discuss which ones they like. No song is liked by all three. Furthermore, for each of the three pairs of the girls, there is at least one song liked by those two girls but disliked by the third. In how many different ways is this possible?",
        "solution": "Let the ordered triple $(a,b,c)$ denote that $a$ songs are liked by Amy and Beth, $b$ songs by Beth and Jo, and $c$ songs by Jo and Amy. The only possible triples are $(1,1,1), (2,1,1), (1,2,1)(1,1,2)$\nTo show this, observe these are all valid conditions. Second, note that none of $a,b,c$ can be bigger than 3. Suppose otherwise, that $a = 3$ . Without loss of generality, say that Amy and Beth like songs 1, 2, and 3. Then because there is at least one song liked by each pair of girls, we require either $b$ or $c$ to be at least 1. In fact, we require either $b$ or $c$ to equal 1, otherwise there will be a song liked by all three. Suppose $b = 1$ . Then we must have $c=0$ since no song is liked by all three girls, a contradiction.\nCase 1 : How many ways are there for $(a,b,c)$ to equal $(1,1,1)$ ? There are 4 choices for which song is liked by Amy and Beth, 3 choices for which song is liked by Beth and Jo, and 2 choices for which song is liked by Jo and Amy. The fourth song can be liked by only one of the girls, or none of the girls, for a total of 4 choices. So $(a,b,c)=(1,1,1)$ in $4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot4 = 96$ ways.\nCase 2 : To find the number of ways for $(a,b,c) = (2,1,1)$ , observe there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices of songs for the first pair of girls. There remain 2 choices of songs for the next pair (who only like one song). The last song is given to the last pair of girls. But observe that we let any three pairs of the girls like two songs, so we multiply by 3. In this case there are $6\\cdot2\\cdot3=36$ ways for the girls to like the songs.\nThat gives a total of $96 + 36 = 132$ ways for the girls to like the songs, so the answer is $\\boxed{132}$",

However, some of the divisors of $2^{10}5^{10}$ cannot be written as a product of two distinct divisors of $2^5 \\cdot 5^5$ , namely: $1 = 2^05^0$ $2^{10}5^{10}$ $2^{10}$ , and $5^{10}$ .

To find these areas, consider the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{BC}$ . Call the point of intersection $E$ . From the previous paragraph, it is clear that $PE = \\sqrt{3}$ and $BE = 1$ .

Thus, the only factors to be concerned about are $3^2\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot13\\cdot17$ , since multiplying by $241$ will make any factor too large.\nMultiplying $17$ by $3$ or $5$ will give a two-digit factor; $17$ itself will also work. The next smallest factor, $7$ , gives a three-digit number.  Thus, there are $3$ factors that are multiples of $17$\nMultiplying $13$ by $3$ $5$ , or $7$ will also give a two-digit factor, as well as $13$ itself. Higher numbers will not work, giving $4$ additional factors.\nMultiply $7$ by $3$ $5$ , or $3^2$ for a two-digit factor. There are no more factors to check, as all factors which include $13$ are already counted. Thus, there are an additional $3$ factors.\nMultiply $5$ by $3$ or $3^2$ for a two-digit factor. All higher factors have been counted already, so there are $2$ more factors.\nThus, the total number of factors is $3+4+3+2=\\boxed{12}$",

A point $X$ in the interior of $R$ is called n-ray partitional if there are $n$ rays emanating from $X$ that divide $R$ into $n$ triangles of equal area. How many points are $100$ -ray partitional but not $60$ -ray partitional?",
        "solution": "There must be four rays emanating from $X$ that intersect the four corners of the square region. Depending on the location of $X$ , the number of rays distributed among these four triangular sectors will vary. We start by finding the corner-most point that is $100$ -ray partitional (let this point be the bottom-left-most point).\nWe first draw the four rays that intersect the vertices. At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas. Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal. The remaining $96$ rays are divided among the other two triangular sectors, each sector with $48$ rays, thus dividing these two sectors into $49$ triangles of equal areas.\nLet the distance from this corner point to the closest side be $a$ and the side of the square be $s$ . From this, we get the equation $\\frac{a\\times s}{2}=\\frac{(s-a)\\times s}{2}\\times\\frac1{49}$ . Solve for $a$ to get $a=\\frac s{50}$ . Therefore, point $X$ is $\\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving $X$ $\\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$ -ray partitional point. We can continue moving $X$ right and up to derive the set of points that are $100$ -ray partitional.\nIn the end, we get a square grid of points each $\\frac s{50}$ apart from one another. Since this grid ranges from a distance of $\\frac s{50}$ from one side to $\\frac{49s}{50}$ from the same side, we have a $49\\times49$ grid, a total of $2401$ $100$ -ray partitional points. To find the overlap from the $60$ -ray partitional, we must find the distance from the corner-most $60$ -ray partitional point to the sides closest to it. Since the $100$ -ray partitional points form a $49\\times49$ grid, each point $\\frac s{50}$ apart from each other, we can deduce that the $60$ -ray partitional points form a $29\\times29$ grid, each point $\\frac s{30}$ apart from each other. To find the overlap points, we must find the common divisors of $30$ and $50$ which are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10$ . Therefore, the overlapping points will form grids with points $s$ $\\frac s{2}$ $\\frac s{5}$ , and $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other respectively. Since the grid with points $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other includes the other points, we can disregard the other grids. The total overlapping set of points is a $9\\times9$ grid, which has $81$ points. Subtract $81$ from $2401$ to get $2401-81=\\boxed{2320}$",

        "solution": "It should first be noted that given any quadrilateral of fixed side lengths, there is exactly one way to manipulate the angles so that the quadrilateral becomes cyclic.\nProof. Given a quadrilateral $ABCD$ where all sides are fixed (in a certain order), we can construct the diagonal $\\overline{BD}$ . When $BD$ is the minimum allowed by the triangle inequality, one of the angles $\\angle DAB$ or $\\angle BCD$ will be degenerate and measure $0^\\circ$ , so opposite angles will sum to less than $180^\\circ$ . When $BD$ is the maximum allowed, one of the angles will be degenerate and measure $180^\\circ$ , so opposite angles will sum to more than $180^\\circ$ . Thus, since the sum of opposite angles increases continuously as $BD$ is lengthened from the minimum to the maximum values, there is a unique value of $BD$ somewhere in the middle such that the sum of opposite angles is exactly $180^\\circ$\nDenote $a$ $b$ $c$ , and $d$ as the integer side lengths of the quadrilateral. Without loss of generality, let $a\\ge b \\ge c \\ge d$\nSince $a+b+c+d = 32$ , the Triangle Inequality implies that $a \\le 15$\nWe will now split into $5$ cases.\nCase $1$ $a = b = c = d$ $4$ side lengths are equal)\nClearly there is only $1$ way to select the side lengths $(8,8,8,8)$ , and no matter how the sides are rearranged only $1$ unique quadrilateral can be formed.\nCase $2$ $a = b = c > d$ or $a > b = c = d$ $3$ side lengths are equal)\nIf $3$ side lengths are equal, then each of those side lengths can only be integers from $6$ to $10$ except for $8$ (because that is counted in the first case). Obviously there is still only $1$ unique quadrilateral that can be formed from one set of side lengths, resulting in a total of $4$ quadrilaterals.\nCase $3$ $a = b > c = d$ $2$ pairs of side lengths are equal)\n$a$ and $b$ can be any integer from $9$ to $15$ , and likewise $c$ and $d$ can be any integer from $1$ to $7$ . However, a single set of side lengths can form $2$ different cyclic quadrilaterals (a rectangle and a kite), so the total number of quadrilaterals for this case is $7\\cdot{2} = 14$\nCase $4$ $a = b > c > d$ or $a > b = c > d$ or $a > b > c = d$ $2$ side lengths are equal)\nIf the $2$ equal side lengths are each $1$ , then the other $2$ sides must each be $15$ , which we have already counted in an earlier case. If the equal side lengths are each $2$ , there is $1$ possible set of side lengths. Likewise, for side lengths of $3$ there are $2$ sets. Continuing this pattern, we find a total of $1+2+3+4+4+5+7+5+4+4+3+2+1 = 45$ sets of side lengths. (Be VERY careful when adding up the total for this case!) For each set of side lengths, there are $3$ possible quadrilaterals that can be formed, so the total number of quadrilaterals for this case is $3\\cdot{45} = 135$\nCase $5$ $a > b > c > d$ (no side lengths are equal)\nUsing the same counting principles starting from $a = 15$ and eventually reaching $a = 9$ , we find that the total number of possible side lengths is $69$ . There are $4!$ ways to arrange the $4$ side lengths, but there is only $1$ unique quadrilateral for $4$ rotations, so the number of quadrilaterals for each set of side lengths is $\\frac{4!}{4} = 6$ . The total number of quadrilaterals is $6\\cdot{69} = 414$\nAnd so, the total number of quadrilaterals that can be made is $414 + 135 + 14 + 4 + 1 = \\boxed{568}$",

        "solution": "First, we note that $f(1) = 1$ , since the only divisor of $1$ is itself.\nThen, let's look at $f(p)$ for $p$ a prime. We see that \\[\\sum_{d \\mid p} d \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{p}{d}\\right) = 1\\] \\[1 \\cdot f(p) + p \\cdot f(1) = 1\\] \\[f(p) = 1 - p \\cdot f(1)\\] \\[f(p) = 1-p\\] Nice.\nNow consider $f(p^k)$ , for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ \\[\\sum_{d \\mid p^k} d \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{p^k}{d}\\right) = 1\\] \\[1 \\cdot f(p^k) + p \\cdot f(p^{k-1}) + p^2 \\cdot f(p^{k-2}) + \\dotsc + p^k f(1) = 1\\]\nIt can be (strongly) inductively shown that $f(p^k) = f(p) = 1-p$ . Here's how.\nWe already showed $k=1$ works. Suppose it holds for $k = n$ , then\n\\[1 \\cdot f(p^n) + p \\cdot f(p^{n-1}) + p^2 \\cdot f(p^{n-2}) + \\dotsc + p^n f(1) = 1 \\implies f(p^m) = 1-p \\; \\forall \\; m \\leqslant n\\]\nFor $k = n+1$ , we have\n\\[1 \\cdot f(p^{n+1}) + p \\cdot f(p^{n}) + p^2 \\cdot f(p^{n-1}) + \\dotsc + p^{n+1} f(1) = 1\\] , then using $f(p^m) = 1-p \\; \\forall \\; m \\leqslant n$ , we simplify to\n\\[1 \\cdot f(p^{n+1}) + p \\cdot (1-p) + p^2 \\cdot (1-p) + \\dotsc + p^n \\cdot (1-p) + p^{n+1} f(1) = 1\\] \\[f(p^{n+1}) + \\sum_{i=1}^n p^i (1-p) + p^{n+1} = 1\\] \\[f(p^{n+1}) + p(1 - p^n) + p^{n+1} = 1\\] \\[f(p^{n+1}) + p = 1 \\implies f(p^{n+1}) = 1-p\\]\nVery nice! Now, we need to show that this function is multiplicative, i.e. $f(pq) = f(p) \\cdot f(q)$ for $p,q$ prime.\nIt's pretty standard, let's go through it quickly. \\[\\sum_{d \\mid pq} d \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{pq}{d}\\right) = 1\\] \\[1 \\cdot f(pq) + p \\cdot f(q) + q \\cdot f(p) + pq \\cdot f(1) = 1\\] Using our formulas from earlier, we have \\[f(pq) + p(1-q) + q(1-p) + pq = 1 \\implies f(pq) = 1 - p(1-q) - q(1-p) - pq = (1-p)(1-q) = f(p) \\cdot f(q)\\]\nGreat! We're almost done now. \nLet's actually plug in $2023 = 7 \\cdot 17^2$ into the original formula. \\[\\sum_{d \\mid 2023} d \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{2023}{d}\\right) = 1\\] \\[1 \\cdot f(2023) + 7 \\cdot f(17^2) + 17 \\cdot f(7 \\cdot 17) + 7 \\cdot 17 \\cdot f(17) + 17^2 \\cdot f(7) + 7 \\cdot 17^2 \\cdot f(1) = 1\\] Let's use our formulas! We know \\[f(7) = 1-7 = -6\\] \\[f(17) = 1-17 = -16\\] \\[f(7 \\cdot 17) = f(7) \\cdot f(17) = (-6) \\cdot (-16) = 96\\] \\[f(17^2) = f(17) = -16\\]\nSo plugging ALL that in, we have \\[f(2023) = 1 - \\left(7 \\cdot (-16) + 17 \\cdot (-6) \\cdot (-16) + 7 \\cdot 17 \\cdot (-16) + 17^2 \\cdot (-6) + 7 \\cdot 17^2\\right)\\] which, be my guest simplifying, is $\\boxed{96}$",

Each person gets up and sits down in a chair that is not the same and is not adjacent to the chair he or she originally occupied, so that again one person is seated in each chair.

        "solution": "Consider shifting every person over three seats left after each person has gotten up and sat back down again. Now, instead of each person being seated not in the same chair and not in an adjacent chair, each person will be seated either in the same chair or an adjacent chair. The problem now becomes the number of ways in which six people can sit down in a chair that is either the same chair or an adjacent chair in a circle.\nConsider the similar problem of $n$ people sitting in a chair that is either the same chair or an adjacent chair in a row. Call the number of possibilities for this $F_n$ . Then if the leftmost person stays put, the problem is reduced to a row of $n-1$ chairs, and if the leftmost person shifts one seat to the right, the new person sitting in the leftmost seat must be the person originally second from the left, reducing the problem to a row of $n-2$ chairs. Thus, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \\geq 3$ . Clearly $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 2$ , so $F_3 = 3$ $F_4 = 5$ , and $F_5 = 8$\nNow consider the six people in a circle and focus on one person. If that person stays put, the problem is reduced to a row of five chairs, for which there are $F_5 = 8$ possibilities. If that person moves one seat to the left, then the person who replaces him in his original seat will either be the person originally to the right of him, which will force everyone to simply shift over one seat to the left, or the person originally to the left of him, which reduces the problem to a row of four chairs, for which there are $F_4 = 5$ possibilities, giving $1 + 5 = 6$ possibilities in all.

        "solution": "WLOG, let the first point be on the bottom side of the square. The points where the second point could exist are outside a circle of radius 0.5 centered on the first point. The parts of the square that lie in this circle are the distance from the point to the closest side of the square $n$ , the distance from the point to the outside of the circle (the radius $0.5$ ), and any portion of the nearest side that lies within the circle as represented by the Pythagorean Theorem $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-n^2}$ . Thus, the total length the second point can exist in can be represented by $f(n)=4-(0.5+n+\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-n^2})$ . Distributing, $f(n)=3.5-n-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-n^2}$\nThen, we can find the average of this function through calculus (wow more calc?).

Graphing the first two, you can see that the first is a rectangle of length $0.5$ and width $3.5$ .

Do note that this is for those that have a limited knowledge of integration or those that have little time but are being very clever.\nOverall, where second point could lie to satisfy the problem is a length of $2(\\frac{7}{4}-\\frac{\\pi}{16}-\\frac{1}{8})=\\frac{26-\\pi}{8}$ . By contrast, the total length where it could lie is the perimeter of the square $4$ .

        "solution": "The huge $n$ value in place, as well as the \"no more than... in a row\" are key phrases that indicate recursion is the right way to go. \nLet's go with finding the case of $S(n)$ from previous cases.\nSo how can we make the words of $S(n)$ ? Do we choose 3-in-a-row of one letter, $A$ or $B$ , or do we want $2$ consecutive ones or $1$ ? Note that this covers all possible cases of ending with $A$ and $B$ with a certain number of consecutive letters. And obviously they are all distinct.\n[Convince yourself that each case for $S(n)$ is considered exactly once by using these cues: does it end in $3$ $2$ , or $1$ consecutive letter(s) ( $1$ consecutive means a string like ... $BA$ , ... $AB$ , as in the letter switches) and does it $WLOG$ consider both $A$ and $B?$\nFrom there we realize that $S(n)=S(n-1)+S(n-2)+S(n-3)$ because 3 in a row requires $S(n-3)$ , and so on. We need to find $S(2015)$ mod 12. We first compute $S(2015)$ mod $3$ and mod $4$ . By listing out the residues mod $3$ , we find that the cycle length for mod $3$ is $13$ $2015$ is $0$ mod $13$ so $S(2015) = S(13) = 2$ mod $3$ .

These equations reduce to $a^3 + a + 1 = 0$ . By sketching a graph of this function, we see that there is exactly one real root.

        "solution": "She walks at a rate of $x$ units per second to travel a distance $y$ . As $vt=d$ , we find $60x=y$ and $24*(x+k)=y$ , where $k$ is the speed of the escalator.

In general, the rational root theorem will be very useful for these situations.\nThe rational root theorem states that all rational roots of $n^3 - 8n^2 + 20n - 13$ will be among $1, 13, -1$ , and $-13$ . Evaluating the cubic at these values will give $n = 1$ as a root. Doing some synthetic division gives \\[n^3 - 8n^2 + 20n - 13 = (n-1)(n^2 - 7n + 13)\\]\nSince $n > 0$ $n-1$ must be nonnegative. Since $(n-1)(n^2 - 7n + 13)$ evaluates to a prime, it is clear that exactly one of $n-1$ and $n^2 - 7n - 13$ is $1$ . We proceed by splitting the problem into 2 cases.\nCase 1: $n-1 = 1$ It is clear that $n = 2$ .

        "solution": "We can rewrite the fraction as $\\frac{123456789}{2^{22} \\cdot 10^4} = \\frac{12345.6789}{2^{22}}$ . Since the last digit of the numerator is odd, a $5$ is added to the right if the numerator is divided by $2$ , and this will continuously happen because $5$ , itself, is odd. Indeed, this happens twenty-two times since we divide by $2$ twenty-two times, so we will need $22$ more digits. Hence, the answer is $4 + 22 = \\boxed{26}$",

Exactly $300$ points in $S$ lie on or below a line with equation $y=mx.$ The possible values of $m$ lie in an interval of length $\\frac ab,$ where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $a+b?$",
        "solution": "I know that I want about $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the box of integer coordinates above my line. There are a total of 30 integer coordinates in the desired range for each axis which gives a total of 900 lattice points. I estimate that the slope, m, is $\\frac{2}{3}$ . Now, although there is probably an easier solution, I would try to count the number of points above the line to see if there are 600 points above the line. The line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x$ separates the area inside the box so that $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the are is above the line.\nI find that the number of coordinates with $x=1$ above the line is 30, and the number of coordinates with $x=2$ above the line is 29. Every time the line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x$ hits a y-value with an integer coordinate, the number of points above the line decreases by one. I wrote out the sum of 30 terms in hopes of finding a pattern. I graphed the first couple positive integer x-coordinates, and found that the sum of the integers above the line is $30+29+28+28+27+26+26 \\ldots+ 10$ . The even integer repeats itself every third term in the sum. I found that the average of each of the terms is 20, and there are 30 of them which means that exactly 600 above the line as desired. This give a lower bound because if the slope decreases a little bit, then the points that the line goes through will be above the line.\nTo find the upper bound, notice that each point with an integer-valued x-coordinate is either $\\frac{1}{3}$ or $\\frac{2}{3}$ above the line. Since the slope through a point is the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate, a shift in the slope will increase the y-value of the higher x-coordinates. We turn our attention to $x=28, 29, 30$ which the line $y=\\frac{2}{3}x$ intersects at $y= \\frac{56}{3}, \\frac{58}{3}, 20$ . The point (30,20) is already counted below the line, and we can clearly see that if we slowly increase the slope of the line, we will hit the point (28,19) since (28, $\\frac{56}{3}$ ) is closer to the lattice point. The slope of the line which goes through both the origin and (28,19) is $y=\\frac{19}{28}x$ . This gives an upper bound of $m=\\frac{19}{28}$\nTaking the upper bound of m and subtracting the lower bound yields $\\frac{19}{28}-\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{1}{84}$ .

Hence, since the number of ways to choose 1 friend is the same thing as choosing 1 to not be friends with, $n=1$ and $n=4$ have the same number of ways. Similarly, $n=2$ and $n=3$ have the same number of ways as well. ~peelybonehead)\nFor $n=1$ , if everyone has exactly one friend, that means there must be $3$ pairs of friends, with no other interconnections.  The first person has $5$ choices for a friend.  There are $4$ people left.  The next person has $3$ choices for a friend.  There are two people left, and these remaining two must be friends.  Thus, there are $15$ configurations with $n=1$\nFor $n=2$ , there are two possibilities.  The group of $6$ can be split into two groups of $3$ , with each group creating a friendship triangle.  The first person has $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to pick two friends from the other five, while the other three are forced together.  Thus, there are $10$ triangular configurations.\nHowever, the group can also form a friendship hexagon, with each person sitting on a vertex, and each side representing the two friends that person has.  The first person may be seated anywhere on the hexagon without loss of generality .  This person has $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ choices for the two friends on the adjoining vertices.  Each of the three remaining people can be seated \"across\" from one of the original three people, forming a different configuration.  Thus, there are $10 \\cdot 3! = 60$ hexagonal configurations, and in total $70$ configurations for $n=2$\nAs stated before, $n=3$ has $70$ configurations, and $n=4$ has $15$ configurations.  This gives a total of $(70 + 15)\\cdot 2 = 170$ configurations, which is option $\\boxed{170}$",

Note that the integers do not have to be distinct.\nSince the mode is $8$ , we have to have at least $2$ occurrences of $8$ in the list. If there are $2$ occurrences of $8$ in the list, we will have $a, b, c, 8, 8, 9, f, g, h, i, j$ . In this case, since $8$ is the unique mode, the rest of the integers have to be distinct.

Clearly the base case of $n=1$ holds, so it is left to prove that $x_{n+1}=(-2)^{n+1}(x_0-60)+60$ assuming our inductive hypothesis holds for $n$ .

The problem asks us to find the number of times we can keep taking the $\\log$ of this expression, until we no longer can (once you reach a negative value, you can't take the log of it anymore; i.e. $\\log$ s are only defined for positive inputs). So, for the context of this problem, what we want to know is:\n\"How many times can I take the $\\log$ of $B$ and get a positive value?\"\nLet's think about what $\\log$ actually means. We want a number $x$ , such that when $2$ is raised to the power of $x$ , we get the expression in the $\\log$ . So, when we think about\n$\\log_2{T(2009)*T(2008)+T(2007)}$\nWhat actually matters? Well, even if you have a big number, say, $124986068$ , what happens when you raise $2$ to the power of that number? We would end up getting another one of these:\nCalculating... ERROR\n(lol \ud83e\udd23)\nBut in all seriousness, whenever we consider tower functions, the next tower number is always much, much bigger. So, back to the problem:\n$\\log_2{(T(2009)*T(2008)+T(2007))}$\n$T(2007)$ is huge... but when you put it next to $T(2008)$ , it looks like an ant. Even more so when it's next to $T(2009)*T(2008)$ . So... what does that mean? Well, if we could get rid of the $T(2007)$ , we could at least go another step. So... let's get rid of it! (At this point I can almost see the audience: *surprised pikachu face)\n\\[\\text{WARNING: THIS SECTION IS FOR CALCULUS USERS ONLY}\\]\n(Just kidding, but yes, the following part of the explanation does incorporate some calculus-related ideas)\nIf we were to consider just\n$\\log_2{(T(2009)*T(2008))}$\nwe would get\n$\\log_2{T(2009)} + \\log_2{T(2008)} \\Rightarrow T(2008) + T(2007)$\nBut what if we wanted to get\n$T(2008) + T(2007)+1$\nas our answer? What would the argument have to be? (In this context, \"argument\" refers to the value in the parentheses). Well, we can work backwards:\n$T(2008) + T(2007)+1$\n$\\Rightarrow \\log_2{T(2009)} + \\log_2{T(2008)} + \\log_2{2}$\n$\\Rightarrow \\log_2{(T(2009)*T(2008)*2)}$\nSo the argument would have to be at least\n$2*T(2009)*T(2008) = T(2009)*T(2008)+T(2009)*T(2008)$\nBut when we compare\n$T(2009)*T(2008)+T(2009)*T(2008)$\nto\n$T(2009)*T(2008)+T(2007)$\nClearly\n$T(2009)*T(2008) > T(2007)$\nSo,\n$\\log_2{(T(2009)*T(2008)+T(2007))}$\nequals some value between\n$T(2008) + T(2007)$\nand\n$T(2008) + T(2007) + 1$\nLet's call that small excess value $\\varepsilon$ (lowercase epsilon, literally \"infinitely small but not 0\"). We want to keep taking the $\\log$ of the expression, and $\\varepsilon$ is going to be pitifully small compared to $T(2008)$ or $T(2007)$ . So, within the context of this problem,\n$T(2008) + T(2007) + \\varepsilon \\approx T(2008) + T(2007)$\nNow we take the $\\log$ again:\n$\\log_2{(T(2008)+T(2007))}$\nLook familiar? It should, because this is almost exactly the same scenario as the one I just made a big fuss about (Take that, you no-know-calculus noobs! On an off note, it's completely fine if you don't know calculus; AMC problems are supposed to solvable by students who don't know calculus.) So, applying the same idea as earlier we have\n$\\log_2{(T(2008)+T(2007))} \\approx \\log_2{T(2008)}$\nFrom here on out, it's calm waters. To recap,\n$\\log_2{(\\log_2{(\\log_2{(B)})})} \\approx T(2008)$\nTaking the $\\log$ $2007$ more times(for a total of $2010$ ), we get\n$\\log_2\\log_2... T(2008) = T(1) = 2$\nTaking the log again, we get\n$\\log_2{2} = 1$\n(Now we're at $2011$ times)\nOnce more and we have\n$\\log_2{1} = 0$\n$2012$ times)\nBut wait, there's more! (IYKYK lol) Remember how we ignored the $\\varepsilon$ ? Well, It's time to bring it back. Every time we took the log, we would get $T(\\text{something})$ $\\varepsilon$ because we defined $\\varepsilon$ to be some very, very small (but finite) number. Let's go back a few steps:\n$\\log_2{2} = 1$\nshould really be\n$\\log_2{(2+\\varepsilon)} = 1+\\epsilon$\nand\n$\\log_2{1} = 0$\nshould really be\n$\\log_2{(1+\\varepsilon)} = \\varepsilon$\nSince $\\varepsilon$ is still a positive number, we can take the $\\log$ of it one last time before it becomes negative. So, after a long and very tiring journey (for both you, the reader, and me, the writer) we have $k$ (the number of times we took the $\\log$ $= 2013 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{2013}$ .\n~TheAsian",

        "solution": "Without loss of generality, choose one of the $12$ edges of the cube to be among the two selected. We now calculate the probability that a randomly-selected second edge makes the pair satisfy the condition in the problem statement.\nFor two lines in space to determine a common plane, they must either intersect or be parallel (in other words, they cannot be skew lines). If all $12$ line segments are extended to lines, the first (arbitrarily chosen) edge's line intersects $4$ lines and is parallel to another $3$ . Thus $4+3=7$ of the $12-1=11$ remaining line segments (which could be chosen for the second edge) give a pair of lines determining a common plane. To see this, observe that in the diagram below, the red edge is parallel to the $3$ green edges and intersects with the $4$ blue edges.\n[asy] import three; import three; unitsize(1cm); size(200); currentprojection=perspective(-6/5,-8/5,7/8); draw((0,1,0)--(0,0,0)--(1,0,0), blue); draw((1,0,0)--(1,1,0)--(0,1,0)); draw((0,0,0)--(0,0,1), red); draw((0,1,0)--(0,1,1), green); draw((1,1,0)--(1,1,1), green); draw((1,0,0)--(1,0,1), green); draw((0,1,1)--(0,0,1)--(1,0,1), blue); draw((1,0,1)--(1,1,1)--(0,1,1)); [/asy]\nThis means that the probability that a randomly-selected pair of edges determine a plane is $\\frac{7}{11}$ , and we calculate that there are ${12 \\choose 2} = 66$ total pairs of edges that could be chosen (without the restriction).
